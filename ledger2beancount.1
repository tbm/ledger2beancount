ledger2beancount - ledger to beancount converter
.P
.SH SYNOPSIS
.P
\fBledger2beancount\fR [options] \fIinput.ledger\fR > \fIoutput.beancount\fR
.P
\fBcat\fR \fIinput.ledger\fR | \fBledger2beancount\fR [options] > \fIoutput.beancount\fR
.P
.SH DESCRIPTION
.P
\fBledger2beancount\fR is a script to automatically convert
\fBledger\fR(1)-based textual ledgers to \fBbeancount\fR files.
.P
Conversion is based on (concrete) syntax, so that information that is
not meaningful for accounting reasons but still valuable (e.g.,
comments, formatting, etc.) can be preserved.
.P
.SH OPTIONS
.P
\fB-c, --config\fR
.RS 4
Specify a configuration file.  The options of the configuration
file are described in \fBledger2beancount\fR(5) and the
\fBledger2beancount\fR manual.
.P
.RE
\fB-h, --help\fR
.RS 4
Show help message and quit.
.P
.RE
.SH USAGE
.P
\fBledger2beancount\fR accepts input from \fIstdin\fR or from a file and will
write the converted data to \fIstdout\fR.  You can run \fBledger2beancount\fR
like this on the example provided:
.P
.RS 4
\fBledger2beancount\fR \fIexamples/simple.ledger\fR > \fIsimple.beancount\fR
.P
.RE
After you convert your \fBledger\fR(1) file, you should validate the
generated beancount file with \fBbean-check\fR(1) and fix all errors:
.P
.RS 4
\fBbean-check\fR \fIsimple.beancount\fR
.P
.RE
You should also inspect the generated \fBbeancount\fR file to see if it
looks correct to you.  Please note that \fBledger2beancount\fR puts notes at
the beginning of the generated \fBbeancount\fR file if it encounters
problems with the conversion.
